Code for the course "Advanced Financial Econometrics" at Aarhus University. 

Topics include: 

Time-varying parameter models: 
- Latent class models for financial econometrics.
- Advances in GARCH models: Markov Switching GARCH and Mixture GARCH.
- Generalized Autoregressive Score models.
- Multivariate models for financial econometrics.
- Systemic risk measurement

Dynamic models of the term structure and exchange rates:
- Yield curve fitting, expectations hypothesis, affine specifications
- Factor models, latent and observed
- Non-linear and non-Gaussian representation
- The relation between term structure dynamics and the shape of the yield curve
- Term structure dynamics and DSGE models
- Foreign currency exchange rate analysis

High Frequency Econometrics: 
- Realized measures (realized volatility, bipower variation, etc).
- Noise robust realized measures (pre-averaging estimator, realized kernel, etc).
- Jumps in high frequency data.
- Volatility forecasting with heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models and realized GARCH.
- Comparison of realized measures.
- Additional topics on realized measures, e.g. volume, liquidity, news announcements.
